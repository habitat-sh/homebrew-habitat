  # Installing "openssl" ensures there's a certificate chain at
  # `/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem`, which our OpenSSL library needs
  # in order to work.
  #
  # Users can install using `--without-openssl` if they don't want
  # this, in which case, they'll need to set `SSL_CERT_FILE` and / or
  # `SSL_CERT_DIR` to appropriate values.
